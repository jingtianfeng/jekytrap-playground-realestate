# Appreciation Night

Each year, Quadra Chemicals Ltd., a Canadian chemical distribution company, hosts an Appreciation Night for its
customers and suppliers. Instead of sending invitations via email, the company decided to build a website with a landing
page to sign up for the event and an admin page to manage the guest list.

## Landing page

The venue can accommodate more people than everyone on the guest list, so they are allowed to invite their friends (
potential customers). In the chemical distribution business, new contracts are usually in the 6 to 7 digits range, and
generating leads at such events can be a game changer for the company. Therefore, the landing page has to look
professional and have good copywriting!

## Admin page

The admin page is a convenience tool. The organizers used to manually type each guestâ€™s name, company and title into a
shared Excel sheet, which became tedious and time-consuming. The Download CSV button allows the guest list (
nametags.csv) to be imported into Adobe Illustrator to auto-generate name tags.
